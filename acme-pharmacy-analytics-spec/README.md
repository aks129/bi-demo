## Executive Summary

This specification defines a **Sigma-class analytics demonstration** for Outcomes' pharmacy products, centered on the fictional client brand **ACME Pharmacy**. The demo showcases an impact-first, multi-stakeholder analytics platform covering:

1. **Client-facing pharmacy metrics analytics** — adherence, gaps, Star Ratings contributors
2. **Executive monitoring** — high-level trend health, cost-of-care signals, strategic KPIs
3. **Internal operations monitoring** — ETL SLAs, feed latency, data quality incidents
4. **Product metrics / OKRs / KPIs** — feature adoption, usage, retention, engagement
5. **Actionable insights & notifications** — rules-driven alerts with playbooks and ownership
6. **Impact-first framing** — every metric tied to outcomes (member health, business value, quality)
7. **AI chat agent** — governed, read-only Q&A over metric definitions and data lineage

This Spec Kit provides **complete requirements, data contracts, wireframes, acceptance criteria, and rollout guidance** for building a production-quality demo that can be showcased to prospects, clients, and internal stakeholders.

## Key Principles

### 1. Impact-First Framing
Every metric, dashboard, and insight is explicitly tied to **business outcomes** or **member health outcomes**. We answer:
- **So what?** — Why does this metric matter?
- **Now what?** — What action should a user take?

### 2. Multi-Stakeholder Design
The demo serves **5 distinct personas** with different goals, access levels, and workflows:
- Client Data Analyst (operational reporting)
- Client Executive (strategic oversight)
- Internal Ops Lead (data pipeline health)
- Product Manager (feature adoption & usage)
- Compliance Analyst (governance & audit)

### 3. Governed & Auditable
- Row-level security (RLS) scoped by client_id, payer_id, or org_id
- Audit trail for all data access and insights
- Metric definitions stored in a versioned catalog
- Data lineage traceable from source → transform → dashboard

### 4. Actionable Insights
- Automated alerts with **ownership, SLAs, and playbooks**
- Deduplication and cooldown logic to prevent alert fatigue
- Escalation paths for critical issues
- "So what / now what" guidance embedded in every notification

### 5. Demo-Safe & HIPAA-Conscious
- Synthetic PII/PHI only (no real patient data)
- Member identifiers masked in client-facing views
- Clear data handling posture documented in [security_privacy.md](security_privacy.md)

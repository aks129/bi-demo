## How to Complete the Spec Kit

### Option 1: Run the Python Generator (Recommended)

```bash
cd acme-pharmacy-analytics-spec
python3 generate_spec_files.py
```

This will create all remaining files (insights/, okrs/, ux/, ai_agent/, sigma_parity/) with substantive content based on the spec templates.

**Note:** The current version of generate_spec_files.py includes:
- All personas (5 files)
- All user stories (6 files)
- All requirements (6 files)
- Partial data_contracts (2 of 4 files)

**To complete:**
1. Enhance generate_spec_files.py with remaining directories
2. OR manually create files using templates in IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

### Option 2: Manual Creation

Use templates in [IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) for:
- insights/rules_engine.md — 5-7 notification rules with conditions, SLAs
- insights/playbooks.md — "So what / now what" action guides
- okrs/*.md — Organizational and product OKRs, metrics tree
- ux/*.md — Navigation, wireframes (ASCII/Mermaid), interactions
- ai_agent/*.md — Problem statement, guardrails, grounding, prompts
- sigma_parity/*.md — Feature list, RLS simulation approach

---

## Next Steps (Recommended Sequence)

### Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Review completed files** with stakeholders:
   - Product reviews: vision, scope, personas, demo_script
   - Engineering reviews: data_contracts, architecture, risks
   - Compliance reviews: security_privacy, governance, rbac
   - Sales reviews: demo_script, success_criteria, personas

2. **Complete missing files:**
   - Run generate_spec_files.py (if enhanced) OR
   - Manually create insights/, ux/, ai_agent/, okrs/, sigma_parity/ using templates

3. **Validate scope alignment:**
   - All 5 stakeholder groups sign off on spec
   - Resolve any conflicts (scope, priorities, timelines)

### Near-Term (Weeks 2-3)
4. **Begin synthetic data generation:**
   - Use data_contracts/schemas.md to build Faker scripts
   - Generate 150K members, 1.2M claims, adherence snapshots
   - Validate data realism with pharmacy SME

5. **Set up infrastructure:**
   - Provision data warehouse (Snowflake/BigQuery/Databricks)
   - Set up dbt project for transformations
   - Configure BI tool (Sigma/Looker/Tableau)

6. **Build MVP dashboards:**
   - Start with Client Analytics (highest value)
   - Use wireframes from ux/wireframes.md
   - Implement RLS per requirements/rbac.md

### Mid-Term (Weeks 4-6)
7. **Internal alpha testing** (Phase 1 of rollout_plan.md):
   - Core team walkthroughs (≥3 iterations)
   - Log bugs, UX issues
   - Refine demo script

8. **Internal beta** (Phase 2):
   - Sales/CSM training (≥2 sessions)
   - Collect feedback (target: ≥4.0/5.0)
   - Iterate on dashboards and narrative

9. **Exec dry-run** (Phase 3):
   - Present to leadership for approval
   - Final polish before external demos

### Long-Term (Weeks 7+)
10. **External demos** (Phase 4):
    - Deliver to 3-5 friendly prospects
    - Track conversion: % → qualified leads
    - Iterate based on market feedback

11. **General availability** (Phase 5):
    - Scale to all prospects/clients
    - Track deals closed, renewals, impact metrics

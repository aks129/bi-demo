## Key Features

### Impact-First Design

Every metric answers two questions:
- **So what?** Why does this metric matter?
- **Now what?** What action should I take?

Example from the dashboard:
```
Diabetes Adherence: 76.4%
⚠ Below Star Ratings threshold

So what? Risk to 4+ star rating
Now what? Identify at-risk members → send refill reminders
```

### 7 Pillars Architecture

1. **Client-Facing Analytics** - Adherence KPIs, Star Ratings impact (✅ Implemented)
2. **Exec Monitoring** - Performance metrics, growth trends (Planned)
3. **Internal Ops** - System health, latency monitoring (Planned)
4. **Product Metrics** - Usage funnels, engagement (Planned)
5. **Insights & Notifications** - Rules engine with playbooks (Planned)
6. **Impact-First Framing** - "So what? Now what?" messaging (✅ Implemented)
7. **AI Chat Agent** - Natural language queries (Planned)

### Data Model

5 tables with 100+ records:
- **User** - Demo users with roles
- **DimClient** - ACME Pharmacy
- **DimMember** - 100 synthetic members
- **FactAdherence** - 300 adherence records (PDC, MPR)
- **FactNotification** - 3 sample alerts

**Vercel Deployment:** ✅ Deployed at https://web-id8sz90ls-aks129s-projects.vercel.app

**Database:** ⏳ SQLite (local dev mode) - needs cloud database for production

**Next Steps for Production:**
1. Set up cloud database (Turso/Neon/PlanetScale)
2. Update DATABASE_URL in Vercel environment variables
3. Run database migrations
4. Seed production database
5. Redeploy

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

   npm run db:seed
   ```

3. Start app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. View dashboard:

   - Note impact-first messaging

### Talk Track

**Setup (30 seconds):**
"This is ACME Pharmacy Analytics, a Sigma-class demo for pharmacy products. It shows what we can build: complete specs, working app, deployed in under an hour."

**Landing Page (30 seconds):**
"Here are our 7 pillars: client analytics, exec monitoring, internal ops, product metrics, insights, impact-first framing, and AI chat. This MVP focuses on client analytics."

**Dashboard (2 minutes):**
"The Client Analytics dashboard shows medication adherence for three drug classes. Notice that Diabetes is at 76.4% - below the 80% Star Ratings threshold. The impact-first messaging tells us why this matters (risk to 4+ star rating) and what to do (send refill reminders).

Below, we see active notifications from the rules engine. Each has a severity, owner, and SLA. Click 'View Playbook' to see the step-by-step action plan.

This is 100% synthetic data - completely demo-safe, no PHI or PII."

**Technical Overview (1 minute):**
"Built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Prisma ORM, and Tailwind CSS. The database has 5 tables with 100 members and 300 adherence records. It's deployed to Vercel with one-click deployment.

The full spec kit has 150+ pages including data contracts, KPI definitions, personas, and a 42-58 hour implementation blueprint for building the complete 7-pillar platform."
